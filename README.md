# üìå Definition and Explanation
Assembly is basically the most basic programming language of a certain hardware. There's a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions: every instruction in the language is a machine code instruction and vice-versa. It was created so that humans don't had to memorize the machine code instructions which are many numbers.

From the Wikipedia:
> In computer programming, assembly language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.

Because of this strong correspondence, the translating process is called assembling instead of compiling, which is the same process but for high-end languages. Those languages do not have this strong correspondence that assembly languages have.

The core of the assembling process is to identify the assembly instructions and translate them to the circuit's instruction binary equivalent. Similarly, it also has to convert each variable to a memory address.

# üî¢ Instructions
Let's take a close look at the instructions available. **Don't worry about syntax right now, we will talk about it later.**

**Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è: If you have never programmed in an assembly language (or with this assembly), please read this section and [üîÄ Code Flow and Tips](#-code-flow-and-tips) in parallel. The *Code Flow and Tips* section will help you understand what to make with the instructions.

### Symbols Legend
Some symbols are used in the Instructions Table. Here you can see their meaning.
Symbol | Explanation
--- | ---
ACC | The ACC register
variable | A variable from the memory
label | Jump label
[ ] | "Value of"
```${varname}``` | Name of a defined variable
```${jumpLabel}``` | Jump label

### Instructions Table

--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
```nop``` | - | This instruction doesn't perform any action | - | No parameter is required
```copy ${varname}``` | [ACC] = [variable] | A value from the memory is copied to the ACC register | variable | It's the name of the variable that will be used in the instruction
```store ${varname}``` | [variable] = [ACC] | The value from the ACC register is stored into memory | variable | It's the name of the variable that will be used in the instruction
```add ${varname}``` | [ACC] = [ACC] + [variable] | The sum of the value of the ACC register and a value from the memory is stored in the ACC register | variable | It's the name of the variable that will be used in the instruction
```sub ${varname}``` | [ACC] = [ACC] - [variable] | The difference between the value of the ACC register and a value from the memory is stored in the ACC register | variable | It's the name of the variable that will be used in the instruction

# üîÄ Code Flow and Tips
This section will help you think more in an assembly way.

Because Open-Machine's Circuit only has very simple commands and very few registers, the way to think about your assembly code will be very different.

# üî° Code Syntax
**Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è: Assembly languages are specific to their hardware so remember that Open-Computer's Assembly may be different from other assembly languages.

Read the specifications below to learn the code syntax.

## General Definitions

### Tabs, spaces and case sensitivity
- Case sensitive;
- **Tabs and spaces** can be used interchangeably;
- Blank or empty lines won't be considered;
- **Numbers** can be written in hexadecimal in the form of ```0xff``` or in decimal as ```255```;
- Comments: characters written after a '#' character will be ignored in the assembly

### Naming Practices
- A **label name** should start with a lowercase letter and the rest of the name can have more letters and numbers;
- Every name should obey the following regex: ```[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*```;
- Snake-case is not allowed, use camel-case instead.

## The Two Parts
The file should be separated into 2 parts: the variable declaration and the actual code, as such:
```
@VAR
# you should declare your variables here

@CODE
# you should add the instructions and jump labels here
```

## Declaring Variables
The syntax of declaring variables is really easy: ```{variableName} = {int value}```.

For example: ```variable = 12``` or ```variable = 0x2```.

## Code

### Jump Label
- Definition: it marks the line for possible jumps to that line;
- Form: ```{labelName}:```
- Remember to follow the [naming practices](#naming-practices)

### Instruction line

***Definition***

An instruction line is a line that contains an instruction call.

***Components***
- ```instruction``` is the actual instruction that will be executed, it must be one of the following in the instruction table;
- ```arg``` can be a jump label or a number (depending on the instruction)

***Form***
- A instruction line should be in the following form ```{instruction} [arg]```;
- An instruction line should obey the following regex: ```^[\t ]*(((nop)|(copy)|(store)|(add)|(sub)|(input)|(output)|(kill)|(jmp)|(jg)|(je)|(jl))(([\t ]+[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*)|()))[\t ]*$```

***Instructions List***

Check out [here](#-instructions) the instruction table to know what instructions you can use and their parameters.

# ‚å®Ô∏è Example
The following assembly code calculates the ```fibonacciNumberIndex```th fibonacci number.
```sh
@VAR
    fibonacciNumberIndex = 8

    oneVarConst = 1
    prev = 1
    current = 1
    auxNext = -1

@CODE
    copy fibonacciNumberIndex
    sub oneVarConst
    sub oneVarConst
    store fibonacciNumberIndex

    for:
        copy prev
        add current
        store auxNext

        copy current
        store prev

        copy auxNext
        store current

        copy fibonacciNumberIndex
        sub oneVarConst
        je end

        store fibonacciNumberIndex
        jmp for
    end:
    output current
    kill
```

# :arrow_forward: Setup and Run
These are the steps to setup and run Open-Computer's Assembler.

You can find more information about the assembler CLI [here](#-assembler-cli) and about running the circuit [here](https://github.com/Open-Machine/Circuits/#Ô∏è-run).

## Setup
1. Build the GoLang project
	```sh
	./setup.sh
	```
2. Clone [Open-Computer's Circuit Repository](https://github.com/Open-Machine/Circuits/)

	You will need this repository to run the assembled program.

	If you have git installed in your terminal, run:
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/Open-Machine/Circuits/
	```

## Run
There are two ways of running your application from the machine code generated by the ```assemble``` command.

### GUI Mode
In this mode, you will be able to see everything that is happening to the circuits in real time and interact with it by changing the inputs.

You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAITQqdOw7c) as an introduction to Logisim-Evolution, which is the program that we will be using to simulate the circuit.

1. Navigate to the Circuits repository
2. Start the circuit: follow the steps <a href="https://github.com/Open-Machine/Circuits/#i-start-the-circuit">to Start the Circuit</a>
3. Right click in the RAM and click "Load Image"
4. Select the assembled file

   You should select the file generated by the assemble program, not the file with the assembly code.

5. To run the program (start the clock simulation), follow the steps <a href="https://github.com/Open-Machine/Circuits/#iii-run-the-circuit">to Run the Circuit</a>

## üíª Assembler CLI
